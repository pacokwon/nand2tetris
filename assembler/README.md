# Assembler

This is the assembler implementation as required in Chapter 6 of the book.

The implementation is written in Rust 1.65. It is also quite overengineered, featuring a full lexer and parser, which is not strictly necessary considering the complexity of this particular task.

## Building
```bash
$ cargo build
```

## Running
```bash
$ cargo run <.asm file>
```
